Repository tutorial
My first computer was an Atari 400.  It featured a microwave style keyboard and 16 kilobytes of memory (yeah you read that right)!  I taught myself to write my first computer program on it when I was eight years old.
These days I provide technical support for Apple computers and mobile devices, although until a few years ago I'd only owned and used PCs.  I'm liking Macs a lot more than PCs now, and I wish I'd switched to Macs years ago.
I'm listening to The Pixies on iTunes, streaming Dark Matter on Netflix, playing BG EET on my laptop and reading Anne Bishop's "The Dark Jewels Trilogy" (for the third time).  
I don't know how I managed to misspell 'hello', and I don't know how to edit the repository name (yet).
Nice ta meetcha.
